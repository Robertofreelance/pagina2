              <strong>COURSE OVERVIEW:</strong> The program is taught by our
              lead instructor and Physician Advisory Board Director, Anne
              Roberts, MD, a Board-Certified Specialist in Internal Medicine and
              Anti-Aging Medicine and a graduate from the prestigious Yale
              University School of Medicine.
              <strong>
                Dr. Roberts is also residency trained from the Mayo Clinic in St
                Paul, MN. In addition to her advisory role with Empire Medical
                Training, Dr. Robins maintains a very busy internal medicine
                practice with a focus on regenerative and weight management
                medicine.</strong

            <p>
              Anti-aging medicine complements conventional medicine. The
              specialty originated from using and applying advanced scientific
              methods for the early detection, prevention, treatment, and
              reversal of age-related dysfunction, chronic disorders, and other
              health related diseases.
              <strong>
                Anti-aging is an evidenced-based interventional medical care
                model that is consistent with those applied in other preventive
                health specialties.</strong
              >
              The anti-aging medical model will allow you to both extend
              lifespan and health span for patients, allowing them to live
              independently and productively for a greater period of time.

                <p class=""><strong>ANTI AGING MEDICINE POPULARITY:</strong> Anti-Aging Medicine and Functional Medicine has quickly become a large model of health care due to the recently-recognized and widely-accepted breakthroughs in hormonal medicine, publicized through the media and other public channels. <strong> Anti-Aging training and integrated medicine is in high demand by medical practitioners due to the well-known benefits achievable for patients and the significant revenue stream created by offering these “in-demand” services.</strong></p>
                <p class=""><strong>PATHOLOGY OF AGING:</strong> Throughout the aging process our bodies change and develop certain deficiencies due to life changes and genetics. We develop various chronic or persistent symptoms that many people ignore or procrastinate until later in life when the problem becomes more serious. Like many conditions in medicine, early intervention, prevention, and treatment will have a significant role in the outcome. Many of these conditions are the result of over/under glandular activity and can be treated effectively with hormonal intervention. Hormones decline as we age, but Bioidentical hormone therapy replaces the hormones that your body needs to function.</p>

                <p><strong>State of the Art Medicine</strong></p>
                <p>Integrative and Regenerative Medicine has, in many cases, replaced traditional medicine models for these chronic ailments and their associated symptomatology by combining therapies that utilizes natural supplements in conjunction with a medically regimented HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapies) program to effectively balance hormones and maintain patients’ state of health and wellbeing.</p>
                <p><strong> Bioidentical Hormones have become popular in part due to the molecular similarity between that occurring naturally in the human body.</strong> Bioidentical Hormones are molecule by molecule exactly the same as the hormones present in the human
                    body. Using Bioidentical Hormones in your medical practice provides additional avenues to effectively treat your patient where you may have been limited in the past to strictly conventional medicine. </p>
                <p>Anti-Aging Medicine and Integrative Medicine is now a 15-billion-dollar market and includes most of the popular, natural treatments and methods to improve overall health and well-being and alleviate many of the chronic conditions that continue to affect the aging patient.  Integrative Medicine is meant to compliment traditional medicine and not necessarily replace conventional medicine.</p>
                <p><strong class="higher">CLASS INFORMATION &amp; MORE ABOUT THE TRAINING:</strong> Understanding how to implement and fully manage your patients using HRT and all the related protocols starting from the initial patient intake to the full patient evaluation, including interpreting laboratory results and implementation of an ongoing treatment plan is an integral component for any medical practice incorporating regenerative medicine and integrative therapies. The evidence-based science that formulates the very basis of how Hormone Replacement Therapy is effective will be thoroughly covered and presented in your course materials. Attendees will also gain a thorough understanding on how to effectively prescribe supplements and nutraceuticals, which will enhance the medical benefits associated with hormone therapy.</p>
